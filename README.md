## üíª Technologies Used
The Player Scouting Recommendation System leverages the following technologies:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, including similarity analysis.
- **Requests**: For handling HTTP requests.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping.
- **Unidecode**: For text normalization.
- **Bing Image Search Python Library**: For fetching player images.
- **Google Generative AI Library**: For generating detailed scouting reports.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
